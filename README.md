## :droplet:  Decentralized Water Harvesting solution.
In today’s world water, a vital resource required for sustaining life is becoming scarce, which is leading to an impure water supply and water shortages. To prevent this, not only are water preservation techniques like rainwater harvesting required, but also water wastage must be prevented. Humans are a selfish species who give money making the highest priority. Our solution innovatively quenches the thirst for money and conserves water.



## :point_right:  Our solution is divided into three components:

1) Rainwater Harvesting:

A user can harvest rainwater using any of the harvesting method he likes and finds suitable. The harvested water is stored in Smart Tanks. After a certain predefined amount of water is collected, quality of water is tested against a set of predefined parameters set by grid administrator. If the test passes, the water is sent to the grid. If the test fails, the user may have an installed water cleaning system to meet the purity parameters and then send it or discard the collected water. Since the water quality is measured before sending it to the grid, the quality of water in supply system is maintained. Since the user ‘Sells’ the water, he earns money which not only motivates him to install rainwater harvesting systems at home, but also covers the cost.

2) Water Supply to Home and Smart Tanks:

Municipality already supply water at out homes, thus we all have our homes connected to supply grid and have water storage tanks at home. A common issue user faces is that either he forgets to power on the pump to fill the tank or he forgets to power off the pump after the tank is filled leading to overflowing and water wastage. The Smart Water Tank takes care of these problems by automatically powering the water pump when water level falls below a certain level and powering it off when water tank is filled. Before the pump starts, it take care of the water quality by first checking the purity of water and only then fills the tanks

3) Implementation using IoT and Blockchain:

Various sensors are used in Smart Tank. They may include water level measuring sensors made simply using wires along with purity measurement sensors like TDS sensors, turbidity sensors. The amount of water purchased (while filling the tanks) and sold (Rainwater harvesting) will account for water bills. Since water is resource whose quality must be maintained at all times, the data from sensors is sent onto online serves using arduino and ESP8266 for monitoring and keeping past records.

This is all implemented on a Blockchain where all the transactions are maintained so that there is no forgery in bills and on the data of quality of water supplied. Since we are using Blockchain, we also introduced micro-transactions so that billing is instantaneous.



Using blockchain we have made a transparent system which anyone can monitor.
Credits are added to your system for every amount of water contributed which can be used later.

#### :point_right: Our prototype is divided into 3 parts :

* 1. TANK 1 (water harvester)-
     Ultrasonic sensors- checking water level.
     Flow sensors- checking quantity of water sent to Central tank.
* 2. TANK 2 (storing water)-
     Ultrasonic sensors:- Automatically filling when needed.
* 3. Central tank (stores water and distributes water when needed)-
     Flow sensors- checking the quantity of water used.

Blockchain solves the problems of unfair water distribution and monopolies, we need more
transparency. Blockchain technology plans to provide water transparency on a massive scale
Blockchain is a secure, transparent and distributed public ledger that records transactions between
parties.

Blockchain removes this single point of failure in an IoT system, by enabling device networks to
protect themselves in other ways. The collaboration between blockchain and IoT water network
changes the way we manage water, without compromising our safety..
Thus by using our system we have made a more efficient way to utilize the water resources and
avoid its wastage by automating using IOT and making a transparent system, free from corruption
using blockchain.
